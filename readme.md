# Hi, I'm a sofwtare Engineer

I'm a full-stack developer for web and mobile applications

Here I list some examples of applications I developed for myself or for university projects:

* **HouseOfTournaments** is a soccer tournament manager. It is developed with React and deployed on a Heroku server.
* **Virgilianotime** is a web application that access the user camera and coordinates two devices to implement an high precision chronometer. (I'm currently developing a mobile app for this project)
* **SPG** is an e-commerce developed following the Scrum process with YouTrack. It was a group project for the "Software Engineering 2" course (Click [here](https://github.com/SE-P10/SPG) for the repository)
* **UX-UI** a group project for the design of a usable interface. It involved the use of Figma and a session of usability-testing
* **ITTrack** is an Andoird app that manages the logistic for products delivery. It scans barcodes and registers the position
* A real-time application, developed in C with RTOS
